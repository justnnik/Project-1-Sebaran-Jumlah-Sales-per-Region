# Project-1 : Sales Revenue Analysis based per Region

## 🧠 Goal

By performing data analysis using Python, this project aims to provide valuable insights that can help FMCG companies make more informed decisions about:
- Which region needs attention about sales strategy
- Which region and product are the highest salesby period
- How to allocate sales strategy to maximize the chances of success

### Distribution of sales and area

## 📈 Conclusion
1. The Yogyakarta region recorded the most stable sales.
2. The Solo region had the highest average sales but was the least stable (possibly due to a large outlier).
3. The Semarang region showed average sales in terms of average and distribution.

## 🧾 Recomendation
1. With average sales varying across regions, customer segmentation can help understand shopping behavior.
2. Evaluate sales from the Solo region, such as whether these transactions are valid or should be excluded from the overall trend analysis
   Conduct a boxplot analysis to identify extreme outliers. Focus on high-transaction customers and ensure their loyalty is maintained.
3. Yogyakarta demonstrates stable sales, so promotional strategies can be focused on increasing purchase volume or frequency.
4. Promotional strategies for the Semarang region can target increasing the average transaction value (upselling).
